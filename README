Pipecut 0.5-alpha README
========================


KNOWN bugs / limitations:
=========================

a)  Multiple arguments to a black box command are not parsed / delivered to execlp().
The code needs a more complete command parser.

b)  Setting multiple flags using '-' has crash-causing use cases not yet debugged.


c)  There's no way to output the full result of your toolset while inside the
UI.

Workarounds:

1. '|' to open the less pager, and do something like '|$cat > /tmp/foo'

2. Save the toolset with ']'. Exit the UI and run 'cat filename | pipecut -t toolsetname'
