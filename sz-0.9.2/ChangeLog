0.1	First draft

0.1a	Began the proliferation of fn's which can work with char *'s
	and sz's, to simplify code using ""'s with sz's.

0.2	Imported makefile and versioning stuff.

0.3	Removed all "char *" variants, replacing them with the hacky
	new (void *) logic.

0.4	Changed the (void *) logic to use 0xFF, 0x01.
	Made sztrunc not modify data - it was cheating on Zen strings,
	and there's no need for a nul byte anyway.
	Fixed up the depth logic a bit, by decrementing depth (if set)
	(instead of killing) in all of the functions which return
	references.
	Made sztrunc modify data, but dezen strings, to make
	szdata() return a plausible string.

0.5	Generalized \ooo and \xXX to use right # of digits for CHAR_BIT,
	which may break some code when CHAR_BIT changes.
	Fixed malloc debugger related logic.
	Fixed L() internal macro for signed char, ISO 8859-1 and related
	systems.
	Added support for \<->\\ to str_decode and szencode.

0.6	sztail() now takes negative numbers to count back.
	Updated email address
	fixed several arguable signed/unsigned conflicts
	Made interal szdezen() fail cleanly if no memory available
	Made sure (I hope!) all memory allocation is checked.

0.7	Cleaned up (I hope) logic in the *cmp functions.
	Removed EXIT_FAILURE workaround for StunOS.
	Added szwrite(), szswrite(), and szfwrite(), and documentation
	for them.
	Added szfread()
	Fixed possible memory leak in szdup() when no memory available.

0.8	Added szfspn, szfcspn (use function, not list of chars)

0.9	Updated copyright for 1998, even though many of the earlier changes
		occured in 1998.
	Added copyright notice to sz.c.
	Made mmspn and mmcspn static, because they're really not a logical
		part of the interface.
	Updated copyright for 1999
	Started on regression tests (very simple so far).
	Fixed makefile for regression tests to work on systems that don't
		know about LDLIBS

0.9.1	Changed "==" to ">=" in szsep, just to be paranoid.
	Tested for more impossible boundary conditions to avoid coredumps.

0.9.2	Added szins, szdel
	Licensing change propogated
	Fixed logic error in sztail for negative n.
